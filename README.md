# Etch-A-Sktech

## A Etch a Sketch created with HTML/CSS and JavaScript

I developed this project as part of my studies through The Odin Project. The website enables users to create drawings by moving their mouse over a personalized grid. The project helped me improve my front-end abilities, particularly with DOM manipulation and event handling. Users can choose to draw in black and white, RGB, or erase their work. The project was an opportunity for me to enhance the following skills:

**CSS**

* Flexbox to create the layout
* Hover effects for button selections

**JavaScript**
* DOM methods to create <divs> within the grid for custom sizes
* Logic to get board size from <input> element with JavaScript
* DOM events to allow the sketch to be made when the user hovers over the grid
* DOM events to allow the user to select the type of trace or eraser

    2. Once the grid appears, the user can select B&W or RGB to color the grid by hovering over the selection
    3. User can select an eraser or clear the grid completely as well
